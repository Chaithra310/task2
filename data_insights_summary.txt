Identifying Patterns, Trends, and Anomalies in the Dataset

1. Patterns & Trends in Numeric Features

Age:
- Pattern: Most passengers are in the 20–30 year age group.
- Anomaly: Few passengers over 70 (outliers).
- Trend: Young adults formed the majority on board.

Fare:
- Pattern: Right-skewed distribution. Most fares are under ₹50.
- Anomaly: A few very high fares (₹200–₹500+) – likely wealthy individuals or group bookings.
- Trend: Higher fare may correlate with survival and class.

Pclass:
- Pattern: Most passengers were 3rd class (~55%).
- Trend: Lower class (higher Pclass number) may link to lower survival odds.

SibSp and Parch:
- Pattern: Many had 0 siblings/spouses or parents/children aboard.
- Anomaly: A few passengers had very large families (5–8 members).

2. Correlations (from heatmap)

- Fare vs Pclass: Strong negative correlation (~ -0.55). As class improves, fare increases.
- Survived vs Pclass: Moderate negative correlation (~ -0.34). First-class passengers survived more.
- Survived vs Fare: Moderate positive correlation (~ +0.26). Higher fare means higher chance of survival.
- SibSp vs Parch: Moderate positive correlation (~ +0.41). Families usually travel with both siblings and parents.

3. Anomalies Identified in Visuals

- Fare Outliers: Boxplots show multiple extreme outliers (₹200+).
- Age Outliers: Elderly passengers (~70–80 years).
- Family Sizes: Some passengers had 6–8 family members—unusual.

4. Insights from Pairplot

Pairplots likely revealed:
- Clear class separation in Fare vs Pclass.
- Distinct clusters (e.g., low Fare and high Pclass = poor passengers).
- Weak visual relationship between Age and Survival.
- Scatter between SibSp and Parch aligns with family groups.

5. Summary Table:

Type     | Feature       | Insight / Anomaly
---------|---------------|------------------------------
Pattern  | Age           | Young adults dominate
Trend    | Fare vs Pclass | More you pay, better your class
Trend    | Fare vs Survived | Higher fare = higher survival odds
Anomaly  | Fare          | Outliers > ₹200-500
Anomaly  | Age           | Few passengers above 70
Pattern  | SibSp & Parch | Most people traveled alone or with 1–2 others
