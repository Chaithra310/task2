Basic Feature-Level Inferences from Visuals

1. Age
- Histogram: Most passengers are young adults (20–30 years).
- Boxplot: Few outliers among older passengers (70–80 years).
- Inference: Age is right-skewed. Young passengers were the majority; age may influence survival or ticket class.

2. Fare
- Histogram: Highly skewed distribution. Most fares are below ₹50.
- Boxplot: Several extreme outliers (₹200–₹500+).
- Inference: Fare has a long right tail; very high fares may indicate VIPs or large groups. Suggests strong class and wealth differences.

3. Pclass (Passenger Class)
- Histogram: Most passengers are in 3rd class.
- Boxplot: Pclass acts like a categorical feature (1, 2, 3).
- Inference: Majority were in lower class (3rd); Pclass likely affects survival and Fare.

4. SibSp (Siblings/Spouses Aboard)
- Histogram: Most passengers traveled alone (0).
- Boxplot: A few high values (5–8).
- Inference: Small families or solo travelers were most common. Large groups are rare.

5. Parch (Parents/Children Aboard)
- Histogram: Most values are 0 (no parents or children).
- Boxplot: Some outliers with large family sizes.
- Inference: Like SibSp, most people didn’t travel with parents/children. Family structures were small.

6. Survived (if present in your data)
- Histogram: Class imbalance may exist (e.g., more 0s than 1s).
- Boxplot: Acts like a binary category.
- Inference: Useful for classification. Helps assess relationships with Age, Fare, Pclass, etc.

7. Correlation Matrix
- Fare vs Pclass: Strong negative correlation (better class = higher fare).
- Survived vs Fare / Pclass: Survival positively linked with Fare, negatively with Pclass.
- SibSp vs Parch: Moderately positive; families often include both.

Overall Takeaways:
- Fare and Pclass are strong predictors of survival.
- Age and family size features show wide variation and outliers.
- The dataset is right-skewed for both Age and Fare.
- Many passengers traveled alone or with small families.
- Some features behave like categories (e.g., Pclass, Survived).
